-- 1. We have noticed that certain customers prefer to make their orders with certain employees. We want
--to increase business by encouraging the customer/employee pairs that are more productive, and to
--channel the pairs that are less productive into other relationships. To this end, we have ordered this
--query and the following three. First, I need the customer ID, the customer contact name, the employee
--ID, the employee name, the order ID, the number of orders, and the total amount of each order, where
--the customer/employee pair has produced five or more orders between them, ordered by the dollar
--amount of the order from highest to lowest. The output needs to be in a comma separated format
--with strings that include spaces and commas delimited by double quotes. The dollar amount should
--be formatted as a decimal number with two decimal places. Here is the output.

select c.customerID, c.contactname, e.employeeID, (e.firstname || ' ' || e.lastname) as emp_name, count(o.orderID) as num_orders, 
	round(sum((od.unitprice * od.quantity) * (1 - od.discount)), 2) as Total_sales from orders o join customers c on o.customerID = c.customerID  
	join employees e on e.employeeID = o.employeeID join order_details od on od.orderid = o.orderid group by o.orderID 
	having count(o.orderid) >= 5 order by Total_sales desc;
