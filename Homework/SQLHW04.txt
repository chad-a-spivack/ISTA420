### 1. In your own words, what is a subquery?

Takes the place of an expression inside of a query.  Used to make the query more dynamic.

### 2. In your own words, what is a self contained subquery?

A subquery that can still run independently of the outer query.

### 3. In your own words, what is a correlated subquery?

A subquery that relies on the tables in the outer query, making it dependent on the outer query and cannot be run independently.


### 4. Give an example of a subquery that returns a single value. When would you use this kind of subquery?

Using the max function to determine the highest sale amount, but also give it a variable name so it can be run dynamically.

### 5. Give an example of a subquery that returns multiple values. When would you use this kind of subquery?

A subquery that returns the number of customers that live in the United States.

### 6. Give an example of a subquery that returns table values. When would you use this kind of subquery?

Using the exists clause.  You'd use it to make sure that you're only querying rows that exist.

### 7. What does the exists predicate do? Give an example.

It only runs the query for rows that exist.  Return customers from Spain where the orderID are the same for the order and the customer.

### 8. What happens if we use the not operator before a predicate? Give an example.

Negates a condition in the Where clause. Select * from customers where orderid not between 3 and 4.

### 9. When you use exists or not exists with respect to a row in a database, does it return two or three
values? Explain your answer.

It returns two values.  A row either exists or it doesn't.  There's no NULL option.

### 10. How would you use a subquery to calculate aggregates? For example, you want to calculate yearly
sales of a product, and you also want to keep a running sum of total sales. Explain how you would use
a subquery to do this.

You'd subquery the total of all sales based on the year.
