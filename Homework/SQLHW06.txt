### 1. What does a set operator do?

Combines rows from two query result sets.

### 2. What are the general requirements of a set operator

Must produce results with the same number of columns, corresponding data must have same data type

### 3. What is a Venn Diagram? This is not in the book.

Two circles that overlap to compare to topics or objects.  Includes difference and similarities.


### 4. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION operator. What does it do?

It unifies the results of two input queries.  If the row appears in any of the input sets, it will apear in the results of the union operator.

### 5. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION ALL operator. What does it do?

Doesn't remove duplicates.

### 6. Draw a Venn Diagram of the INTERSECT operator. What does it do?

Returns results of rows that are common to both queries.  The small overlapping circle in a venn diagram.

### 7. If SQL Server supported the INTERSECT ALL operator, what would it do?

Returns only duplicates of instances where both queries have a match.

### 8. Draw a Venn Diagram of the EXCEPT operator. What does it do?

Returns differences.  One of the circle of a venn diagram minus the section that overlaps with the other circle.

### 9. If SQL Server supported the EXCEPT ALL operator, what would it do?


Returns an occurence only if it doesn't have an occurence in the second query.

### 10. What is the precedence of the set operators?

Intersect, Union, Except.
