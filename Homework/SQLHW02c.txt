### 1. List the date/time types in T-SQL.

DATETIME, SMALLDATETIME, DATE, TIME, DATETIME2, DATETIMEOFFSET

### 2. How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL?

As a character string literal.


### 3. What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for?

How SQL interprets the literals you enter when they are converted from a character string type to a date time format.


### 4. Wriite a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German. Read the documentation on how to do
		this.
		
Select Format(@date, 'D', "de-de") result;


### 5. What is the difference between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()?

COnvert() explicitly changes the char-string literal to the requested data type.  Cast converts a value of any type into the specified type, but can't request a style. 
Parse() Can only convert strings to numbers but you can determine what culture is used to interpret the date.

### 6. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events, such as user logins.

Current_Timestamp.

### 7. How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year?

DATEADD(day), DATEADD(week, 1) , DATEADD(month, 1), DATEADD(Year, 1);

### 8. Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and todayâ€™s date.

Select DATEDIFF(year, '19910823', SYSDATETIME());


### 9. How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date?

You use the ISDATE function.

### 10. What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful.

Returns the respective end of month date as a date typed value.  Querying pay checks? Maybe figuring out total sales on the last day.

### 11. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculatesthe date of the next payment. 
Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains thedate of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.

SELECT DATEADD(DD, 30, @DAte); Cast as DueDate;

### 12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days untiltheir 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.

Select DATEDIFF(day, SYSDATETIME(), 'whatever date their birthday is')
