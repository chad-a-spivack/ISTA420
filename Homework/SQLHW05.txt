### 1. What is a table expression? Can you give a technical definition of a table expression?

A named query expression that represents a valid relational table. It is a query that is used as a table.  The table doesn't actually exist.

### 2. In what SQL clause are derived tables (table valued subqueries) located?

The *From* clause.

### 3. Why can you refer to column aliases in an outer query that you defined in an inner table valued
subquery?

They are evaluated prior to the *Select* clause in the outer query.

### 4. What SQL key word defines a common table expression?

Using a *with* statement.

### 5. When using common table expressions, can a subsequent derived table use a table alias declared in a
preceding table expression?

no

### 6. Can a main query refer to a previously defined common table expression by multiple aliases?

Yes

### 7. In SQL, is a view a durable object?

yes

### 8. In a view, what does WITH CHECK OPTION do? Why is this important?

Prevent modifications that conflict with the view's filter. You can't add rows that conflict with the filter.

### 9. In a view, what does SCHEMABINDING do? Why is this important?

It binds the schema to the referenced object.  This is important if you do not want any of the data in the referenced onject to be altered.

### 10. What is a table valued function?

Reusable table expressions that support input parameters.

### 11. What does the APPLY operator do?

Similar to a join but it works with derived tables.
